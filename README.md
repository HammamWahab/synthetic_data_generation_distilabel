# Synthetic Data Generation with Distilabel

This repository demonstrates the generation of synthetic data using **Distilabel**. It is used to create a dataset for **AWS Solution Architecture** problems, leveraging the **Python SDK**. The dataset is based on the [VishaalY/solutions-architect-hf-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/VishaalY/solutions-architect-hf-dataset) available on Hugging Face.

Results from the synthetic data generation can be found here:

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the code for synthetic data generation using **Distilabel**.  
- **`main.py`**: Entry point for running the synthetic data generation process.  
- **`data/`**: Directory containing the generated synthetic dataset.

## Features

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Automatically generates AWS Solution Architecture datasets using Distilabel.  
2. **AWS Python SDK Integration**: Implements AWS-related solution architecture problems using the Python SDK.  
3. **Dataset Availability**: The dataset is made available on Hugging Face for further use and experimentation.
